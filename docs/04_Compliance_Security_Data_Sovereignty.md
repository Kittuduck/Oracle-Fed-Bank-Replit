# Compliance, Security & Data Sovereignty Document: Federal Bank Digital Application

## 1. Compliance Framework (KYC/AML)

The application mandates strict adherence to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) guidelines for digital onboarding and ongoing account monitoring.

### 1.1 Digital Onboarding & V-KYC
- **Real-time Verification:** The onboarding flow relies on active API verification of the Primary Account Number (PAN) via NSDL and Aadhaar via UIDAI's OTP-based eKYC.
- **Video KYC (V-KYC):** As per RBI mandates for full-KYC accounts without branch visits, the embedded Video KYC SDK ensures:
  - Live photo capture (Liveness detection).
  - Geotagging to confirm physical presence within India.
  - Concurrent matching of the live facial image against the Aadhaar database photo using AI facial recognition APIs.
- **AML Screening:** All newly created profiles are run asynchronously against Federal Bank's central Anti-Money Laundering (AML) watchlists and sanction lists (e.g., OFAC, UNSC) before full account activation. 

## 2. Data Privacy, Consent Management & PII Handling

Handling Personally Identifiable Information (PII), particularly demographic and biometric data, requires zero-trust privacy architectures.

### 2.1 Aadhaar & PAN Handling
- **Aadhaar Vault integration:** The 12-digit Aadhaar number is never stored in plain text anywhere in the application or application databases. Upon UIDAI validation, the number is instantly tokenized and stored in a highly restricted, HSM-backed Aadhaar Data Vault. Reference keys are used for all subsequent internal system processing.
- **Data Masking:** Only the last 4 digits of Aadhaar/PAN are exposed on the UI.
- **Memory Management:** Mobile clients actively flush securely held variables (e.g., plain-text PAN strings, Aadhaar numbers, OTP variables) upon navigating away from the onboarding screen or pushing the app to the background to prevent memory scraping.

### 2.2 Consent Architecture
- **Explicit Opt-in:** Granular, un-bundled consent checkboxes for Terms & Conditions, FATCA declarations, CKYC registry fetch, and promotional communications.
- **Consent Artifacts:** Every consent action logs an immutable event tied to a UUID, device ID, IP address, and precise timestamp, supporting digital auditability as required by the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act.

## 3. Security Architecture & Encryption Standards

### 3.1 Network & Data Security
- **Data in Transit:** Enforced TLS 1.3 for all client-to-server communications. Certificate pinning is heavily implemented within the mobile app to thwart Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
- **Data at Rest:** All local device storage (e.g., caching of user settings or encrypted auth tokens) utilizes platform-native secure enclaves (iOS Keychain / Android Keystore). Database volumes are encrypted using AES-256.

### 3.2 Authentication & Session Management
- **Device Binding:** Upon first login, the user's mobile device is cryptographically bound to their account. Subsequent logins from new devices require a step-up authentication flow (SMS OTP + Email OTP or Debit Card validation).
- **Session Lifecycle:** 
  - Absolute session timeout is set at 15 minutes of inactivity. 
  - Tokens (JWTs) have a short TTL (Time To Live) of 5 minutes, relying on a secure sliding refresh token mechanism.
- **Biometric Enforcement:** Support for WebAuthn/FIDO2 standards where FaceID or TouchID actions are verified locally over a secure enclave before transmitting signed payloads.

### 3.3 Audit Trails & Observability
- **Immutable Ledger:** All financial and non-financial (e.g., address change, nominee update) transactions log to a Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) audit ledger. 
- **Non-Repudiation:** Transaction requests contain a cryptographically signed payload generated by the local mobile app instance.
- **Fraud Telemetry:** Background signals—including device jailbreak/root status detection, screen-sharing or overlay detection, and anomalous geolocation leaps—are continuously streamed to Federal Bank's central Fraud Risk Management (FRM) engine. The "Emergency Shield" UI (rendered in bright orange alert colors) instantly surfaces if high-risk activity is detected.
